# Webpage Code Refactor Homework

## Description 

The purpose of this exercise is to implement accessibility features to any users accessing the content of the webpage.  This includes semantic elements within the html to provide context for the content of the page, as well as descriptive alt tags to describe images to the visually impaired.

In addition to accessibility, this exercise also focuses on the simplification and re-organization of styling that is applied to the webpage, so that the styling compliments the html structure in a logical manner.  This includes both the simplification and consolidation of the css styles, as well as re-ordering the css to align with the content of the html document.
